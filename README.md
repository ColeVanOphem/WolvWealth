# Welcome to WolvWealth!

**Elevate your investment strategy with precision and confidence.**

## About

We're disrupting finance by empowering your investment decisions with our cutting-edge modern portfolio optimizer, utilizing advanced algorithms to build diversified portfolios tailored to your risk preferences and financial goals.

WolvWealth is a web application that democratizes high quality investment portfolio management by making it easy for anyone to create an optimized stock portfolio with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for WolvWealth emerged from our shared passion for democratized financial technology and the desire to empower investors with a sophisticated yet user-friendly tool to optimize their investment portfolios. We recognized the need for a platform for the everyday investor that integrates cutting-edge technologies, allowing users to make informed decisions, maximize returns, and manage risk effectively.

## What it does
WolvWealth is a portfolio optimization website and API that provides users with a robust toolset for optimizing their investment portfolios. The platform utilizes various optimization algorithms using machine learning estimators, and allows users to specify their financial goals for the optimizer to consider. The optimizer optionally takes in as input the initial cash, initial stock holdings, stock universe (the stocks the optimizer will choose from), the output format (shares or weights), the chosen risk model, and the optimization algorithm. It runs the optimization and outputs the new portfolio in an easily-digestible format, providing the shares or the weights as specified. The functionality can be accessed through the frontend or an API, allowing users to run optimizations programmatically.

## How we built it
We built WolvWealth using a tech stack that combines Python, Flask, and PyPortfolioOpt. The backend is powered by Flask, providing a robust and scalable API foundation. PyPortfolioOpt's optimization algorithms are seamlessly integrated, enabling accurate and efficient portfolio optimizations. The frontend is designed with a modern, sleek, and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and React, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. The app is hosted on Google Cloud.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, including determining how to utilize the PyPortfolioOpt API for our purposes, the performance of the portfolio optimization algorithms, ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend, fine-tuning the user interface for a balance of simplicity and functionality, as well as some technical difficulties. We experienced particularly difficult setbacks when it came to sourcing our stock price and historical price action data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully developing a comprehensive portfolio optimization tool within the given timeframe. We transformed sophisticated financial optimization algorithms into a tool that users can realistically employ at this very moment to make informed investment decisions. We take pride in offering a platform that is immediately accessible for anyone ready to take control of their investment strategy. Furthermore, we tackled the challenge of learning and seamlessly incorporating Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and React into a cohesive and powerful financial optimization platform before the end of the allotted time.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of WolvWealth, our team gained valuable insights into the complexities of financial portfolio optimization. We deepened our understanding of optimization algorithms and risk assessment. Additionally, the project enhanced our collaboration skills and highlighted the importance of user-centric design in financial applications. We also learned Flask and the React framework.

## What's next for WolvWealth
Looking forward, we envision expanding WolvWealth by incorporating additional features such as real-time market data, personalized user profiles and settings, and more advanced optimization strategies and risk models. We plan to further enhance the user experience by providing additional insights to guide users to make confident, data-driven decisions, and explore opportunities for integration with financial APIs. WolvWealth is just the beginning, and we are excited about its potential to revolutionize how individuals approach portfolio management.
